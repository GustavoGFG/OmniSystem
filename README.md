Welcome to OmniSystem! It's the upgraded version of a previous project. In the past, we used Python and Selenium to gather sales data and send daily reports. If I still had access to the data, I'd enhance it further by integrating either Puppeteer or Cheerio to unlock its full potential. Unfortunately, due to changes in my situation, I no longer have access to the necessary data.
